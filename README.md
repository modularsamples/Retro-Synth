# Wavetables for Retro Synth

## 500 wavetables and counting..

- [Web Audio Demo](https://www.modularsamples.com/Demos/demos/retrotables.html)

This collection distills the wider Modular Samples library into a bunch of wavetables, patches and Smart Control Panels for Logic's Retro Synth instrument. 

Recently updated with over 80 new wavetables, new patches and better organisation.

## **Installation:**

Copy the contents of each folder to the corresponding folder found in Music/Audio Music Apps/

Please note that by installing this collection you will loose any 3rd party or self created wavetables. This is because logic only allows 1 user wavetable file (RetroSynthWavetable.plist)

UPDATE: Since the last commit all wavetables are now available as seperate presets. This means you can keep your original RetroSynthWavetable.plist if you prefer. You wont be able to access these wave from the dropdown menu any more, instead the are accessed using the preset browser.

## **Usage:**

**Patches:** Load an instance of RetroSynth in Logic and select a patch from the Library window.

**Channel Strip presets:** Create a new track and select a preset from the Channel settings menu.

**Track stacks:** Create a new summing stack from the Tracks menu, then, from the library panel select a stack preset.

**Note:** Both channel & stack presets feature a Smart control panel that you may find useful.
